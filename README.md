# RecordMe
This is RecordMe app. The main feature is recording and playing this records.
In the future I'll try add make transcript from record feature. This app will be great opportunity
to check how to set app in Google Play Store and give me more experience in programming.

For start:
todo (02) Create base fragment and layout for record and play
todo (03) add to fragment layout record and play buttons
todo (04) Create navigation resources
todo (05) Create view model for that fragment
todo (06) figure out how to record a sound
todo (07) figure out how to set up needed permissions
todo (08) figure out how to save this record sound and hot to play it on demand
